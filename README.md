# NBA Contracts - A Data Visualization Project

## Backend:
- Jsoup
- Spring Boot 2.0

## Frontend:
- React
- Bootstrap or Semantic or just CSS?
- D3.js

# About this project:
This project accomplishes two objectives: 
1. Build a RESTful API with Spring Boot 
2. Build data-driven UI diagrams. 

I also want to get practice using React as well as Java. As someone with a strong interest in data visualization, this project allows me to have fun and learn at the same time :)
